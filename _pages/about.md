I am a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information [(SCI)](http://sci.pitt.edu), University of Pittsburgh. I work at PITT Computational Social Dynamics Lab [(PICSO)](https://picsolab.github.io) directed by Dr. [Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/index.html), and PITT Initiative on the Computational Social Science [(PittCSS)](https://pittcss.github.io). I worked at Facebook (2019), Sumsung Research America (2018). 

News
======
I am currently **on the job market** and looking for a research position. Please contact me with relevant opportunities!

Research
======
My research lies in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, data/network science, and computational social science. I am motivated to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in complex social systems, and to support data-driven decisions for social good. I use methods including network analysis and modeling, statistical analysis and causal inference, data mining and machine learning techniques. My major [research projects](/research/) include:
- tackling spurious associations in practical observational studies (with a focus on Simpson's paradox), and supporting humans to achieve better data-driven decisions.
- battling COVID-19 infodemic, including characterizing user susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation on social media, as well as assessment of offline risk of COVID-19 from online misinformation.
- modeling and understanding the dynamics of information and disease in networks, as well as detecting anomaly in dynamic networks.

Check out my [publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) for more information.


Updates
======
- **11/2021** I defended my dissertation proposal and officially become a PhD candidate.
- **08/2021** I gave a presentation of our work at PaCSS 2021.
- **07/2021** Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09532) is accepted by ICWSM 2022. This study seeks to understand online susceptible users, i.e., those who are likely to be attracted by, believe and spread COVID-19 misinformation, ranging from social bots to humans with various misinformation engagement levels.
- **03/2021** Our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9132696) is published at IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics. We utilize deep generative learning to address the disease progression uncertainty in diease forecasting problem.
- **01/2021** Our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20399-3) is published at Nature Communication. We provide a framework to optimize the selection of surveillance site locations and show that accurate forecasting of respiratory diseases for locations without surveillance is feasible.
- **08/2020** I gave a presentation of our work at Politics and Computational Social Science (PaCSS) 2020.
